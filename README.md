## Time Management

As asked by the speaker running the lesson, this section will be providing prevision en feedback on work done for each session

### 26 October 2018

#### TODO

    As the application we were asked for is quite big, I will get to it a way I'm not used to : I'll start with the front !
    Today, my goal is to setup a new Vue.js application, using boostrap-vue and to create an interface I may feed with the
    large amount of data we need to display. I will focus on the employee interface and the differents tabs we will need.

### What I've done '?'

    The main structure is here. I've got a Vue.js project running and webpack building my app correctly. I did begin the interface for the employee personna. This is really basic and need more thinking and refinment.

    The problem here is that there is a lot of functionnalities to add to one interface. Next session work may be about filter functionnalities I feel I'm able to implements, and add values loading to this interface (loads user profile from json)

    First time with webpack, and thanks to Vue.js it wasn't so hard. A lot of informations are already provided by the *vue-cli* template.

## Access *state-of-the-art* application

The project is builded and pushed to [my github.io page](https://killy85.github.io/#/)
